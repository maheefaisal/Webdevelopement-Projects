        Though Napoleon came from the Corsican nobility. He was not destined to
        find his fortunes in Corsica as they came from the minor branch of the
        nobility.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus his father allied with the French to advance his family's social
        status. As a result, this afforded Napoleon the chance to study in French
        military school.
    </p>

    <p>
        Napoleon graduated around the time of the French revolution. Which
        furnished him with the opportunity to advance in rank at a breakneck
        speed.
    </p>

    <p>
        Napoleon's wide-ranging knowledge about many aspects of the military
        helped he wins admiration and victories were previously other generals
        were getting defeated.
    </p>

    <p>
        His first chance of spotlight came in the battle of the pyramids on 21
        July 1798. Here Napoleon defeated a larger Egyptian force compared to his.
        This was also the battle where Napoleon's divisional square's deadliness
        was proved.
    </p>

    <p>
        You have probably heard of Hitler, right? It took only one coalition to
        defeat Hitler. But to take down Napoleon it took seven coalitions of
        Germany, Russia, Prussia, and other nations.

        <mark>"A leader is a dealer in <sup>hope</sup> " said Napoleon.</mark>
        This was true for many French after the revolution. After France was
        released from the shackles of the monarchy many saw their prospects change
        as they couldn't have dreamed of.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many people who were from <sup>working-class</sup> backgrounds now had
        access to posts in the government, which previously only could be accessed
        by the nobility. Napolean also gave new laws for the French people.
    </p>

    <p>
        His generous funding of the sciences and arts helped France produce
        talents in many different fields of science. But his constant wars costed
        France very dearly. More than five million soldiers died due to his
        constant war mongering.
        <br />
        <del>He was a monster.</del>
