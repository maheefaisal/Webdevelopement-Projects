    <p>Though Napoleon came from the Corsican nobility. He was not destined to
        find his fortunes in Corsica as they came from the minor branch of the
        nobility.</p>

    <p>Thus his father allied with the French to advance his family's social status.
        As a result, this afforded Napoleon the chance to study in French
        military school.</p>

    <p> Napoleon graduated around the time of the French revolution. Which
        furnished him with the opportunity to advance in rank at a breakneck
        speed.</p>

        he wins admiration and victories were previously other generals were
        getting defeated.</p>

    <p> His first chance of spotlight came in the battle of the pyramids on 21

        government, which previously only could be accessed by the nobility.

        died due to his constant war mongering.</p>
