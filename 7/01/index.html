        <h1>Marilyn Monroe</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="two">
        <p>Marilyn Monroe (/ˈmærɪlɪn mənˈroʊ/; born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 4, 1962) was an
            American actress, model, and singer. Famous for playing comedic "blonde bombshell" characters, she became
            one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s and was emblematic of the era's sexual
            revolution. She was a top-billed actress for only a decade, but her films grossed $200 million (equivalent
            to $2 billion in 2020) by the time of her death in 1962.[1] Long after her death, she continues to be a
            major icon of pop culture.[2] In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Monroe sixth on its list of the
            greatest female screen legends from the Golden Age of Hollywood.

            Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage and
            married at age 16. She was working in a factory during World War II when she met a photographer from the
            First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career, which led to short-lived film
            contracts with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures. After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new
            contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several
            comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't
            Bother to Knock. She faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before she
            became a star, but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her
            films.

            By 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars; she had leading roles in the film noir
            Niagara, which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a
            Millionaire, which established her star image as a "dumb blonde". The same year, her nude images were used
            as the centerfold and on the cover of the first issue of Playboy. She played a significant role in the
            creation and management of her public image throughout her career, but she was disappointed when she was
            typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project
            but returned to star in The Seven Year Itch (1955), one of the biggest box office successes of her career.

            When the studio was still reluctant to change Monroe's contract, she founded her own film production company
            in 1954. She dedicated 1955 to building the company and began studying method acting under Lee Strasberg at
            the Actors Studio. Later that year, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger
            salary. Her subsequent roles included a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and her first
            independent production in The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). She won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for
            her work in Some Like It Hot (1959), a critical and commercial success. Her last completed film was the
            drama The Misfits (1961).

            Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction and mood disorders. Her
            marriages to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and to playwright Arthur Miller were highly publicized, and
            both ended in divorce. On August 4, 1962, she died at age 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her home in
            Los Angeles. Her death was ruled a probable suicide, although several conspiracy theories have been proposed
            in the decades following her death.</p>

            Who Was Marilyn Monroe?
            Actress Marilyn Monroe overcame a difficult childhood to become one of the world's biggest and most enduring
            sex symbols. Her films grossed more than $200 million. She is known for her relationships with Arthur
            Miller, Joe DiMaggio and, possibly, President John F. Kennedy. Monroe died of a drug overdose on August 5,
            1962, at only 36 years old.

            Early Life and Education
            Monroe was born on June 1, 1926, in Los Angeles, California. Monroe was named Norma Jeane Mortenson at birth
            (later baptized as Norma Jeane Baker). Growing up, Monroe spent much of her time in foster care and in an
            orphanage.

            In 1937, a family friend and her husband, Grace and Doc Goddard, took care of Monroe for a few years. The
            Goddards were paid $25 weekly by Monroe's mother to raise her.

            The couple was deeply religious and followed fundamentalist doctrines; among other prohibited activities,
            Monroe was not allowed to go to the movies. But when Doc's job was transferred to the East Coast, the couple
            could not afford to bring Monroe with them.

            At seven years old, Monroe returned to a life in foster homes, where she endured sexual assault on several
            occasions; she later said that she had been raped when she was 11 years old. She dropped out of high school
            by age 15.

            Monroe had a way out through marriage, and she wed her boyfriend and merchant marine Jimmy Dougherty in
            1942, at the age of 16.

            Monroe never knew her father. She once thought Clark Gable to be her father — a story repeated often enough
            for a version of it to gain some currency. However, there's no evidence that Gable ever met or knew Monroe's
            mother, Gladys, who developed psychiatric problems and was eventually placed in a mental institution.

            As an adult, Monroe would maintain that one of her earliest memories was of her mother trying to smother her
            in her crib with a pillow. Monroe had a half-sister, to whom she was not close; they met only a half-dozen
            times.</p>
