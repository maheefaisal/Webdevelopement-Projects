    Portrait of <cite>Napoleon Bonaparte</cite>
    <p>
        Napoléon Bonaparte (15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to
        prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He
        was the de facto leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor
        of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more
        than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these
        wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its
        final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at
        military schools worldwide. He remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in human
        history.
